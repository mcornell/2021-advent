/*
Each entry consists of ten unique signal patterns, a | delimiter,
and finally the four digit output value. Within an entry,
the same wire/segment connections are used (but you don't know what the connections actually are).
The unique signal patterns correspond to the ten different ways the submarine
tries to render a digit using the current wire/segment connections.
Because 7 is the only digit that uses three segments, dab in the above example means
that to render a 7, signal lines d, a, and b are on. Because 4 is the only digit that
 uses four segments, eafb means that to render a 4, signal lines e, a, f, and b are on.
